# Ames House Price Estimation with Python

Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting house prices in Ames, Iowa, utilizing advanced statistical analysis and supervised learning algorithms. The dataset used for this analysis was compiled by Dean De Cock, specifically for data science education. The primary objective is to leverage the dataset to develop a model that can estimate the price of a house based on user-inputted features, effectively assisting potential buyers in determining the approximate cost of their dream home.

Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing:
Handling Missing Data: Addressed missing values in the dataset through imputation or removal strategies, ensuring a clean and complete dataset for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features and transformed variables to enhance model performance.
Data Scaling: Scaled numerical features to bring them to a similar scale, preventing certain features from dominating the model training.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted a thorough analysis of the Ames House Price dataset to gain insights into the distribution of variables, relationships between features, and potential outliers.

3. Model Building:
Implemented several supervised learning algorithms to predict house prices:
Linear Regression: A simple, yet effective, linear model for predicting house prices.
Ridge Regression: Introduced regularization to linear regression to prevent overfitting.
Lasso Regression: Another regularization technique that aids in feature selection.
Support Vector Regression (SVR): Utilized support vector machines for regression tasks.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: Constructed an ensemble of decision trees to improve predictive performance.
Random Forest Regression: Employed a forest of decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy.
Decision Tree Regression: Implemented a single decision tree as a baseline model for comparison.

5. Model Evaluation:
Assessed the performance of each model using relevant metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
